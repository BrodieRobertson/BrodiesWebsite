				<h2 class="center-text">Hey I'm Brodie Robertson</h2>
				<p>To be completely honest, I didn't think I would ever get to the point
				where some random person like you would want to visit my website but here
				we are.</p>
				<p>I don't know if you'd frame it like this but I'm most well known online
				for showcasing various pieces of Linux software which catch my attention,
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BrodieRobertson">which you
					can check out here</a>.</p>
				<p>If that's not your thing I'll also cover I'll also occasionally various
				other pieces of Linux or Linux adjacent topics such as
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Monqjo-3MOA">"What is
					Swap Space"</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrUNK1EO8GQ&t=4s">
					"Linus Torvalds Ponders The Future Of The Linux
					Kernel"</a> so if Linux is your jam I'm sure you'll find something to
				interest you.</p>

				<h2 class="center-text">I'm still fairly new to Linux all things considered</h2>
				<p>It may come across in my videos like I'm someone who's been using Linux
				for years and has tons of experience with this sort of software but in reality
				I've only actually been daily driving Linux close to 2 years, so occasionally
				I'll make some mistakes.</p>
				<p>Being interested in software for most of my life I've known about Linux for
				a long time but I didn't really consider trying it out until I discovered Linux
				content creators like Bryan Lunduke, Luke Smith, Distrotube and many others.</p>
				<p>I didn't even wait get comfortable with Linux before making videos as you'll
				see from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDcVU1SZKuM">some of my early
					content</a> but I feel like in the last
				couple of months I've finally reached a point where what I know, what I know I
				can learn and what I can teach people can finally provide some actual value.</p>
				<p>The software I use is always changing but you can see what I typically
				use <a href="software.html">here</a></p>
				<p>Along with my video content I'll also chuck together some scripts and config
				files from time to time and all of this is available on my
				<a href="https://github.com/BrodieRobertson">GitHub</a>.</p>

			<div class="small-margin">
				<h2 class="center-text">I'm a big weeb and I don't hide that fact</h2>
				<p>Now if you've ever seen one of my videos it should be pretty obvious that I'm
				a bit of a weeb, if you don't like that well toughen up and stop worrying about
				what other people like, besides the shirts and the anime wallpapers you're not
				going to see any of that content on this channel,
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRjzjpJ02WDNfDCfFI6fvElS-_u9Hp9gM">
					at least anymore</a>.</p>
				<p>If you pop your head into the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrUNK1EO8GQ">
					Discord server</a> expect to be
				spammed with anime emotes and be surrounded by other weebs, honestly I've found
				that most people tend to not care about the shirts I wear because I act like a
				functioning human being when I'm in public.</p>
				<p>Besides that I'm also really big into <a href="library.html">reading light novels</a>,
				sadly my bookshelf is getting a littl bit full so it's looking like I might
				need to buy a new one, since I have no plans to get rid of any of my existing
				books.</p>
				<p>I still also still love video games but while I've been in my final year of
				uni I haven't really been able to find the time to play anything, that'll probably
				change when I start streaming though, if I'm being completely honest that's one of
				the big reasons I want to start streaming just so I can say I'm working when I'm
				playing Persona.</p>

				<h2 class="center-text">I have a podcast called Tech Over Tea</h2>
				<p>Soon to have it's own website, for now <a href="https://anchor.fm/tech-over-tea">
					check it out on Anchor</a></p>
				<p>To be completely honest this podcast is only a tech podcast in name
				maybe when the guests I bring on are super into tech as well we might
				touch on it from time to time but most often it's just whatever nonsense
				we can come up with.</p>
				<p>If you expect to leave this podcast having learned anything useful
				you're in the wrong place 99% of the time, but none the less I still try
				to make it worthwhile experience for all the listeners and viewers</p>
				<p>There's also a video release of the podcast over on
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TechOverTea">Youtube
				</a> and <a href="https://open.lbry.com/@TechOverTea:3">LBRY</a>.</p>

				<h2 class="center-text">I'm still in the process of finishing University</h2>
				<p>I've spent the last 3 and a bit users studying Software Engineering and
				whilst i've met a lot of awesome people and learnt a lot of cool not too
				useful things, I can say hands that it's not worth the effort especially
				if you're interested in programming.</p>
				<p>Most of the material you'll cover will come from free online ../resources
				and at least in my experience some of the teachers have never worked as an
				industry dev and barely know more than the students, but I'll save the rest
				of my rant for another time.</p>
				<p>Will I end up using my degree? At this stage only time will tell, I believe
				that if I keep pushing hard everyday one day I'll get to the point where I can
				live my life the way I want to live it, and this blog exists to bring you guys
				along that journey with me.</p>
