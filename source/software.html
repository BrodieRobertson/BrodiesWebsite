			<h2>Server Setup</h2>

		<section id="software">
			<h2>Software I Use</h2>
			<h3>Priorities</h3>
			<p></p>
			<div>
				<h4>Web Browser</h4>
				<p>Even though the CEO and company have made some seriously questionable
				descisions during the lifetime of this web browser my current choice is Brave
				which you download with my link <a href="">here</a>. I've used Vivaldi,
				Chomium and Firefox in the past on Linux and they're all about the same but
				Brave comes with internet money so it's a plus for me.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Terminal</h4>
				<p>I've cycled through a bunch of different terminals like URXVT, Kitty, and
				st but the one that I've currently settled on is Alacritty. It does
				everything that I need from a terminal, easy key remapping, true color,
				it's lightning fast and is dead simple to configure. Unlike certain other
				terminals it's not just a walking LOC meme.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Video Player</h4>
				<p>Why even bother asking about my video player, if you're not using
				MPV you're doing it wrong. The only other acceptable answer is MPlayer
				which is just MPV without the GUI controls.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Image Viewer</h4>
				<p>I need to view images not file my taxes, just give me some simple window
				that shows me the image I want to look at and Sxiv seems to do that job as
				well as I could possibly expect. Feh is also a really good alternative as
				well and doubles as a wallpaper setter but I have my reasons for using
				XWallpaper for that particular job.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Crypto Wallet</h4>
				<p>I have secondary wallets for things like Tron staking but my primary
				wallet for the time being is Exodus, it has all the coins supported that I
				could possibly want and also comes with a pretty slick interface, I'm not
				really sure what else I would move to if I stopped using this one.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Text Editor</h4>
				<p>Right now it's obviously going to be Vim, or I guess it's actually NeoVim
				but for the most part the behave the same way it's not until you start
				spending way too much time customizing your editor that you really start
				to spot the difference.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Video Editor</h4>
				<p>Even though I hate it and I want to use something better for now I'm
				kind of stuck using Kdenlive, I have tried out other editors like OpenShot
				which is seriously lacking in features and Olive which has a serious memory
				leak so for now I'll stay where I am. When Olive is stable I'm without a
				doubt switching over to that instead.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Image Editor</h4>
				<p>Most of my image editing work is done with thumbnails in mind, I don't
				typically find myself doing much else and I find that GIMP seems to do
				basically all if not everything I need from an image editor. If you've
				come from using Photoshop, GIMP may seem a little bit clunky and in many
				ways that's true but it's capable of most of what normal people use Photoshop
				for.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Video/Audio Recording</h4>
				<p>For recording all of my videos I use OBS because having switchable scenes
				is really nice and much easier to handle than just doing it in post when I
				need to frequently move around the camera. As for audio recording typically
				this is done inside of OBS alongside the video but when I need to do it
				seperately my go to choice is Audacity.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Email Client</h4>
				<p>Thunderbird simply just Thunderbird, you can make the argument that you just
				need a terminal based email client but I do like being able to see images in the
				emails I receive. Thunderbird also comes with some other nice things like a
				calender, a schedule and various other ueful things that I'd be too lazy too
				check if they were in another app.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Operating System</h4>
				<p>It should be pretty obvious that I'm running Linux but what distro am I running
				well obviously I'm running Arch btw. I'm considering trying out Artix on my next
				install but for now I'm happy on Arch.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Fonts</h4>
				<p>For my web browser I like having my fonts look like they did back when I was on
				Windows, I know that a lot of people like having custom fonts in their browser but
				that's not my thing so I always install the Noto Fonts package. On my desktop, in
				my terminal and everywhere else on my system I'm currently running JetBrains Mono.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Window Manager</h4>
				<p>I've been considering trying out other options like DWM, Qtile, Berry and a few
				others and back when I first started out on Linux I was running i3 which was great
				but then I discovered BSPWM and ever since that day I've just been hacking on this
				window manager to make it behave exactly the way I want.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>File Manager</h4>
				<p>I've got 2 file managers installed on my system at all times, a GUI and a
				terminal file manager. Most of the time I use the terminal file manager but when
				I'm interacting with GUI applications the GUI file manager comes out but any I'm
				currently running lf as the terminal choice and PCManFM as the GUI choice.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Torrent Client</h4>
				<p>Currently I'm just using Transmission, and to be completely honest there's
				nothing keeping me attached to it, I'm pretty much only using it because it's
				what I've been since I first installed Linux and I haven't been bothered to try
				out anything else. As for the interface I'm just using tremc which is a python 3
				rewrite of transmission-remote-cli.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Office Suite</h4>
				<p>Are there even any choices of Linux, on the rare chance I need an office suite
				I'll be running Libre Office, typically I only use it for dealing with my taxes and
				documents that other people from Uni send me, if I have control I wouldn't be using
				it.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>RSS Reader</h4>
				<p>Typically I only use RSS for looking at various Reddit feeds because I hate
				the site but it's great for farming content so my RSS Reader of choice is currently
				Newsboat, it does everything I need it to do and runs in my terminal so it's an
				obvious choice.</p>
			</div>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Hardware I Use</h2>
			<div>
				<h4>Monitor</h4>
				<p>I bought an <a href="">ASUS VL279HE</a>, it's a completely usable monitor
				but it does have some annoying problems like the stand which is really wobbly
				and I already have a dead pixel on it which isn't great but it's ok on a budget.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>CPU</h4>
				<p>Originally I was supposed to have <a href="">AMD Ryzen 9 3900X</a> in
				this system but due to <a href="">issues during the build process</a>
				I had to replace it and the only thing I could get was an
				<a href="">AMD Ryzen 5 3600X</a>, which to be completely honest is fine.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>GPU</h4>
				<p>GPU rendering on Linux is sort of a meme so I really on got the
				<a href="">Gigabyte Radeon RX 570</a> so that I'd have some sort of video
				out and it'll be fine for streaming some light games, if I get into
				streaming PC games I'll replace it with something bigger in the AMD lineup.
				Not due to being a fan of AMD, it's just that Nvidia is hell on Linux.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Motherboard</h4>
				<p>The <a href="">Asus PRIME X570-P</a> is a motherboard, I don't know what
				else to say about it, it's not the cheapest X570 board and it's not the most
				expensive and it has almost too many USB ports which is nice. I like it.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Powersupply</h4>
				<p>Is the <a href="">EVGA SuperNOVA G+ 650W</a> way overkill for my system,
				yeah without a doubt, I should have dropped down to the 550W model instead but
				this will do for now and it gives more room to grow than I ever plan to do.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Case</h4>
				<p>Cheap cases have come along way since the last time I built a PC and the
				<a href="">InWin 101</a> is one of the best examples of this, it's not
				best designed case interally but it does the job and doesn't slice your hand
				open. It doesn't come with any fans which is sort of a bumber but it does have
				a full glass side panel which is pretty neat.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Cooling</h4>
				<p>For my CPU cooler I went with the <a href="">Noctua NH-U12S</a> which being a
				Noctua CPU cooler is an absolute beast and is more than I need for my CPU. For
				the case fans I went with a 3 pack of <a href="">Corsair Air Series AF120</a> with
				red LEDs to go with the AMD CPU and GPU, not really they were just the only ones in
				stock so they were what I bought.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Memory</h4>
				<p>I forgot to order RAM with the rest of my parts and the
				<a href="">Corsair Vengance LPX 32GB</a> was the last 32GB kit left in stock
				at my local computer store, I didn't need low profile memory in this system but
				there's no harm in having it.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Storage</h4>
				<p>I'm rocking 3 drives in my desktop an <a href="">Corsair Force MP510 480GB</a>
				as my boot and root drive, a <a href="">Seagate 2TB BarraCuda</a> as my home drive
				and a <a href="">Crucial BX500 120GB 3D</a> which currently exists as a Windows 10
				drive but will probably just turn into the drive I nuke when I want to run an OS
				on hardware rather than in a VM.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Peripherals</h4>
				<p>The keyboard I'm using which I've showed from time to time in the podcast is a
				<a href="">Cougar Vantar</a>, which is a scissor switch keyboard (not to be confused
				with butterfly switch) because scissor switches are hands down a better typing
				experince than the alternatives, when I replace it I'll probably get something like
				the <a href="">Cherry KC 6000 Slim</a>. For my mouse I couldn't tell you what it is,
				it's just some random no name mouse that does the job and that's about all.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Audio Output</h4>
				<p>In the podcast you'll see me wearing earphones, these are a pair of <a href="">
				Logitch CX 3.00</a>, they're not super cheap but they're not super expensive,
				I've been buying these for years now and they sound pretty good. When I just want
				to chill out and use my speakers my go to is an <a href="">LG 300W Soundbar</a> it's
				not the best sounding thing out there but it's good enough for watching YouTube and
				anime.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Microphone</h4>
				<p>I'm currently rocking a <a href="">Blue Yeti</a> it's pretty much the
				standard YouTube mic but I wouldn't reccomend it since it has some
				fundamental hardware flaws. As for my microphone arm it's just some cheap
				thing I got off of Ebay and the same is true for the wind foam, you don't
				need to spend much on this stuff. My shock mount is <a href="">
					Knox Gear Mount</a> but you can find the same one rebranded as
				<a href="">Auphonix</a> and presumably other names as well.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Webcam</h4>
				<p>If all you need is a view of your face the <a href="">Logitech C920 Pro</a> is
				good enough and if you're streaming games, most of the time the camera will
				so small that a better camera won't make much of a difference.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Lighting</h4>
				<p>Lighting is always important but especially so when using a webcam, I
				currently use 2 <a href="">Neewer 176</a> point lights to light up my face
				one to the left of the scene and one to the right, they're both on cheap
				stands I got off ebay. My background is lit up by some random lamp I
				got from Bunnings that I decided to stick a stupid bright bulb into and it
				seems to do the job.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Laptop</h4>
				<p>It's basically been retired at this point but my laptop is an Acer Swift 3
				which was the display unit so I got a bit of a discount on it, it was a good
				laptop back when I bought it but it's got a lot of hardware problems now and
				it's sort of at the end of it's life.</p>
